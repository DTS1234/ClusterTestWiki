# Welcome to Cluster Test Wiki

This documentation provides comprehensive information and guidance for the Cluster Probe and Probe Builder projects. These software packages are designed to
facilitate testing of Kubernetes clusters in terms of scalability and performance. The primary objective of these projects is to create a software-based
solution for testing typical cloud service use cases within the context of [reCluster](https://github.com/carlocorradini/reCluster) project, a self-aware cloud
orchestration system. Through this
documentation, you will gain insights into the functionalities, architecture, implementation, testing, API specifications, and user guide for both Cluster Probe
and Probe Builder. Whether you are new to testing Kubernetes clusters or seeking to enhance your existing knowledge, this documentation will serve as a valuable
resource to understand and utilize these tools effectively.
